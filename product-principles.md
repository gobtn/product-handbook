The purpose of these principles is to facilitate high-velocity decision making and drive alignment across teams on critical questions that can’t be verified factually.

# Product Principles
## The user is your friend.
Or in Google’s words “focus on the user and all else will follow”.  We optimize long-term customer value over short-term revenue gain. We prioritize the interest of users above all others - publishers, merchants, brands, partners and company stakeholders. We will not compromise user data for financial gain.

## Actions, not Ads. 
We value manifested intent over manufactured intent. People only have 24 hours in each day. We build a better business in mobile with actions that helps people do more of what they want to do, quicker, and returning as much of people’ valuable attention to them. 

## Bias towards scalability. While solving a problem manually a few times is a great way to learn it well enough so as to scale it, we aim for products that scale exceptionally well and to provide Omotenashi through technology rather than manual service. We bias towards providing an outstanding self-service experience to achieve scale. 

## Aim for universality.
We aim to build universally applicable products to all customers in all markets over custom solutions. We are building a better, scalable model for many-to-many relationships on the same affiliate concept, rather than porting one-to-one relationships and term sheets into a mobile world.

## Build trust through transparency.
Transparency is critical to ensure our insights are trusted by business owners so they may anchor their decision making on it. Our methodology, validation, and results are transparent to business owners, and available for audit. 

## Stand on the shoulders of giants. 
We leverage analogies to well-known concepts and standards when they help our products be self-explanatory and dispense of user manuals.
