The purpose of these principles is to facilitate high-velocity decision making and drive alignment across teams on critical questions that can’t be verified factually.

Guidelines for these principles:
- **Tenets state the how**. Our mission and vision states the what ; tenets are principles and core values that the program or team uses to fulfill the mission.
- **Be memorable**. Two attributes of memorable tenets are challenging the reader, and being concise.
- **Each tenet has only one main idea**. Chiseling a tenet down to a single essential idea makes the tenet memorable and clear.
- **Counsel, not law**. Tenets help individuals make hard choices and trade-offs. They take a stand by declaring that a program cares more about one thing than another. There will be tension between tenets. And sometimes the right decision may be deviating from one. That may be okay, with adequate explicit reasoning.
- **Tenets keep you honest**. It’s easy to get caught up in group-think or distracted by the nuances of a specific project and lose sight of the overall goals. Stepping back, setting tenets, and then considering those tenets along the way (only changing them when you step back again) will help you keep track of the wider strategy.


# Product Principles / Tenets
### The user is your friend.
Focus on the user and all else will follow.  We optimize long-term customer value over short-term revenue gain. We prioritize the interest of users above all others - publishers, merchants, brands, partners and company stakeholders. We will not compromise user data for financial gain.

### Actions, not Ads. 
We value manifested intent over manufactured intent. People only have 24 hours in each day. We build a better business in mobile with actions that help people do more of what they want to do, quicker, and returning as much of people’ valuable attention to them. 

### Bias towards scalability. 
While solving a problem manually a few times is a great way to learn it well enough so as to scale it, we aim for products that scale exceptionally well and to provide Omotenashi through technology rather than manual service. We bias towards providing an outstanding self-service experience to achieve scale. 

### Aim for universality.
We aim to build universally applicable products to all customers in all markets over custom solutions. We are building a better, scalable model for many-to-many relationships on the affiliate concept, rather than porting one-to-one relationships and term sheets into a mobile world.

### Build trust through transparency.
Transparency is critical to ensure our insights are trusted by business owners so they may anchor their decision making on it. Our methodology, validation, and results are transparent to business owners, and available for audit. 

### Stand on the shoulders of giants. 
We leverage analogies to well-known concepts and standards when they help our products be self-explanatory and dispense of user manuals.
